**1 POST-INSTALL TOOLTIP**

All published add-ons require a post-install tooltip. The post-install tooltip is a sentence or two that pops up immediately after a user installs an add-on; this text is meant to direct the user to the very first step they should take to use your add-on after installation. Refer to our UI Style Guide for more on what an [effective tooltip](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/style#post-install_tip) looks like.

**2 ADD-ON STORE OVERVIEW TEXT**

The Overview Text is displayed in the store, and is used to tell users what the add-on does and what problems it solves. This text should focus on the add-on; avoid talking at length about related services or the developer. It is important that this text be clear, accurate and concise -- otherwise users may not install or use your add-on at all.

**3 GRAPHICAL ASSETS**

For publication, you'll need at minimum 3 specific assets:  a 128px ? 128px icon, a 1280px ? 800px screenshot, and a 440px x 280px tile image. These graphics are used in the web store to display and advertise your add-on, so make them look good! Refer to our asset guide at [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/style#in_the_store](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/style#in_the_store)

In addition, you may want to consider producing a short YouTube video, which can be embedded in the web store listing.

See our [branding guidelines](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/branding) for more information.

**4 HELP WEB PAGES**

During publication, you can provide a URL that will be connected to the "Help" menu item for your add-on.  A good add-on will have a well-designed, well-maintained web page describing its use and purpose in detail.
